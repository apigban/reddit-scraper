Heard about the harsh drug laws over there (going to jail for invisible amounts of cannabis etc.) and already planned to go there with new clothes/shoes to prevent trouble with traces of that stuff. (Smoked pot a couple of times this year).\n\nHowever, it has now come to my attention that even trace amounts of THC in your blood/urine counts as \"possession\".\nI read a lot about how these tests work and I'm rather convinced that there will be traces left although I had my last smoke 3-4 weeks ago.\n\nMinimum punishment for this is 4 years in jail...\n\nIn most stories I heard about this, the urine test did not came out of nothing but because the tourist was in trouble for some other issue, i.e. carrying medicine or \"acting suspicious\" or looked like a stoner.\n\nMy question to all you travelers is, how likely is it to get such a treatment upon arrival at the airport? It's not hard to find stories like this on the internet, on the other hand there are lots of reports from people claiming to have lived there for years, entering and existing the country without beeing bothered once (not even a regular check at customs).\n\nI'm seriously thinking about canceling my trip as the risk is hard to estimate. What are the chances for a special treatment? 1:10, 1:100 or more like 1:1000? Any experiences?\n\n**EDIT**:\nThanks for your answers guy, I'm a bit more confident now.

[...] transiting passengers carrying even residual amounts of drugs are arrested. Passengers in transit under the influence of drink or drugs may also be arrested and can face four years in jail. *The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession.*\"\n* [Some other dude, two cannabis seeds where found in dirt in his bag, tough](http://www.orato.com/travel/customs-arrest-dubai-for-carrying-pot) (with a video he recorded from inside the airport detention cell).\n* [Three fellows from Amsterdam having been tested for urine](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=1985953)\n* etc. etc.\n\nIn some of the cases, nothing was found on the first search, and when the urine test was negative, the baggage was searched again until some dirt \"appeared\".
